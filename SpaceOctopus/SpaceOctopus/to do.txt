every  release: check these:
* cheats
* Tweaking flags 
* version number in Options menu
* git diffs
* tile icon
* do a release build (check .xap file's modified date)
* check description, including category

[ ] change Category to Shooter again!

[ ] "In love with SOM? Please rate it in the App Hub!"

[ ] swap P1 and P2 positions, scores etc in 2player mode. so P1 is the single player player.
[ ] p2, when she has doublefire, her shots appear visibly beneath her gunbits :(
[ ] when a shot is destroyed it should become particles like everything else.
[ ] spirit shots death particles should float upwards

Art Sets:
[ ] support different art sets (hard coded, no transitions)
[ ] crude artset transitions - transition forward every 10 levels
[ ] make art sets affect the menus too
[ ] draw Art Set 2: classic white & black invaders
[ ] art set 3: gold
[ ] art set 4: winter
[ ] art set 5: pencil sketch
[ ] art set 6: original SOM graphics

- [maybe] art - make all enemy navigation logic + spawning based on the _default_ character size
- [later] art - make the swipe-to-transition code
- [later] art - make particle physics art-set-dependent


========================
You are not allowed to do anything below here until you have the new artsets.
========================

off topic: make a simple one-button game like canabalt, but online with everyone connected and seeing each other. Awesomeness.

* alien beams shouldn't just be limited by maxbeams, the firing rate should be global, not per-alien. ish.
* redo the whole level progression: go level by level, introducing one new challenge per level
 e.g. the levels that add one to 'max beams' should always be octo-only levels.
 basically change that method so that it goes level-by-level rather than feature-by-feature.
 and if (level >= 4) maxbeams++; if (level >= 20) maxbeams++; a better way to do it.

PHASE 2
- smoke trail behind the player ship? to give a sense of motion
- when player is 'damaged', draw a line showing the height that the player is flying back up to.
	-alternately, the engine glow effect could communicate this
- menu transitions should use particlefx - particles must persist from menu to gameplay.
[ ] make player temporarily invulnerable after being revived
[ ] monk fire sound starts too late
PHASE 3

PHASE 2.4
[ ] ? analytics FTW! That is how I can save my game and conquer the market
[ ] AI player - and consider making the game _always_ two player. This will help with balance.
[ ] CPU profiling
[?] crazy random occurances: rainbow particles, invisible level, bosses.
- new 'hard' difficulty, unlockable.
[ ] rationalise special stage generation code so i can tell what's going on.
- improve early level variety
[ ] big block aliens that fly in, sit near the front, and absorb several shots.
	- need a flash-when-damaged system.
	- Make a copy of the sprite with all pixels white
	- when damaged, draw it at full-bright, and fade it out


PHASE MAYBE
[ ] make movement analogue, not binary. I need a real phone to test this on.
- (may already be fixed) special stage performance - it feels jumpy
[ ] a whole wave of 5 special stages in a row - SPACE OCTOPUS MONO: SPECIAL EDITION
- bug: if 'Aliens got past you!', it says 'tap to restart' but the player may want to continue playing.
[ ] single player score should fade in and out - when you got a multiple of 100, or when you're in a special stage.
- improve high score boards - base on score, not level - level is extraoneous information
- special stage with rocks moving at different speeds - gives an awesome fo-parallax effect.
- temporary invulnerability powerup
- sideways thruster particle effect on the player ship
- powerup: freeze time (with awesome visuals)
- powerup: kill everything (including shots)
- make the score display not eat memory every frame.
[ ] lightwave cannon particles should have less gravity\be lighter
- new powerup - a gun turret that sits in place, firing (or bounces left and right, perhaps)
- 1 player + BOT
- special level where you 'collect' instead of avoid
- performance: make particles larger when there are too many particles. can happen with lightwave cannon.
[ ] allow names on high scores.
[ ] consider using a noise overly as a transition effect, or when players are damaged, or just to generally noise things up
- rainbow particles at some point, somewhere.
- stats: total playtime.

Unimportant memory leaks:
the drawStrings may be leaking memory.
shooting may be leaking memory.

PHASE NOT LIKELY
[ ] test the hell out of the serialization code
[ ] re-enable 4-way movement in the menu. Add a health\death system to support 4 way movement.
- known issue - if after losing, you exit before the high score screen appears, your new high score will not be saved.
- fix serialization of powerups - right now some second-level upgrades are not serialized.
- upgrades are unlockable - once unlocked, aliens can drop them
- make an upgrade come half way through each 'avoid' level
- tweak stars & monks timings - once all visible stars are dead, the next wave must emerge immediately.
- make the sound option actually work, and uncomment it to add to the options menu
[ ] disable idle detection, if i add acceleromter support http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.phone.shell.phoneapplicationservice.applicationidledetectionmode(VS.92).aspx
- monks - spawn height difference is too close together.
- background image! or particles, something. gradually darkening background?
- use larger particles and make them last longer. For some weapons\enemy types anyway.
- main menu - you slide '1 player' item sideways to change the number of players? that's cooler. and there's a 'new game' option above it.


PHASE NEVER
- experiment with larger particles
- fix all the 'New Color(...) needless instantiations.
- only drop powerups that the player needs
- NO: recode to suit the fixed framerate - at least, make shots always happen every n frames.
[ ] Improve my tombstoning\resuming - I should resume to exactly where I was. At the least, I should capture player data at the moment of exiting
- fix all memory allocation - no garbage collection in my game!
- consider - instead of particles disappearing, they become part of the background - paint a picture.
- now that particles are huge, they can be animated - i.e. spin horizontally in 3d by getting thinner and fatter.
- freaking cool - instead of 'score' being a number, display all the creatures killed as tiny icons across the bottom of the screen.
	at the end of each level, collapse them into a score number.
- let users create their own artsets using in in-game pixel art editor.

CHANGE LOG ================================================

-- Release v 1.4

No change (except version number)

-- Release v 1.3

(stats tracking)

2010-11-30
[x] stats tracking - home home on first run trial, first run full version.
[x] changed title tile to 'Space Octopus' instead of blank - got tired of fixing it as Visual Studio removes the blank title each time you save, annoying.
[x] added a 'SimulateTrial' flag to Tweaking so I can more easily simulate trial mode.

-- Release v 1.2

(improved controls, reduced difficulty.)

2010-11-13
[x] new relative-controls similar to other similar games.
[x] increased player speed by 50%
[x] made special stages easier (slower, more spread out)
[x] the special 'split stage' won't spawn seeking blocks along the split
[x] the enemy's max simultaneous beams increases more gradually
[x] beams take longer to become harmful, and are harmful for less time, delivering less damage overall.
[x] added, then removed, a two player control scheme using on-screen buttons. Oops.
[x] made two player controls share the screen top-vs-bottom instead of left-vs-right. Much better idea.
[x] tried to explain the two player controls better to the players
[x] fixed a bug with player's maximum shake
[x] bumped displayed version number to 1.2

-- Release v 1.1
(improved two player mode)

2010-10-26
[x] two player - redraw some upgrades for player 2 so they fit the different ship design
[x] bumped version number displayed in options screen to 1.1
[x] Fix app description to look good with no line breaks - remove the redundant second sentence that comes before the bullet points.
[x] disable cheats

2010-10-26
performance: Trying to eliminate all memory allocation during gameplay.
[x] generate explosion maps once per enemy type, not once per enemy instance! fixes a slow down at the start of large levels
[x] pool ParticleGroups, pre-create their expensive particle[] arrays. The arrays must all have the maximum size that could be needed.
[x] protip: (enum.Equals(anEnum)) allocates memory, (enum==enum) doesn't.
[x] eliminated shot[] memory allocation in Particle.move()
[x] virtually all memory allocation is now gone! 
(but have these memory improvements have actually improved the game's smoothness? I'm not sure. I need to test that seperately.)

2010-10-24
gameplay:
[x] If both players touch a powerup at the same time, the player who is most directly under it will get it. (Previously, player 1 always got the powerup.)
[x] score is now displayed in single player.
[x] during a special stage, your score increases constantly
[x] in 2 player mode, when one player is lost there is a text message.
[x] 2 player: when one player is dead, the surving player will get 'revive' powerups that bring them back
[x] fixed an issue where if two shots hit an enemy at exactly the same time, both were destroyed. Now one hits 'first' and the other passes through.

visuals:
[x] new sprite for player 2 and player 2 shots.
[x] layout: move player 1's score a bit left so higher scores can fit on screen
[x] graphics: pointless changes to powerup art
[x] graphics: added gravity to particles - maybe it's just me, but i think this looks amazing!
[x] gravity does not affect lightwave cannon particles (still doesn't look that good though)
[x] graphics: particles are swept away by passing shots
[x] graphics: more energetic explosions, longer particle duration.
[x] layout fix: in two player, the 'tap to restart' text used to appear on top of the players' scores.

2010-10-18
[x] Windows version, including
[x] - file reading and writing
[x] - menu navigation with keyboard
[x] - 2 player keyboard controls
[x] - exit button
[x] - packaged ready to release
[x] huge improvements to file reading\writing code to facilitate windows version.

-- Release v 1.0
yay!

2010-10-11
[x] fix icons having seen how bad they look in the unlocked emulator (thanks, unlocking hackers!)
[x] the very first avoid level is far too hard. It should be brain-dead easy. The second one is probably ok.
[x] fix shading bug! in two player, some shots appear grey
[x] redo (some) screenshots now that monks look awesometastic.
[x]	panoramic background 1000x800
[x] disable cheats

PHASE 0.2 - before submission
[x] Test! Test for the hills!
[x] 30 make a website with support information. (Google App Engine?)

2010-10-10
[x]	replace game.ico
[x] redraw monks, boy they suck. (Yay, they look awesome now! pity I already took the screenshots :/   )
[x] changed pixel size from 13 times to 12 times, to make it split evenly into 4x4 subpixels.
[x] remove height boost powerup - it's confusing and lame.

[x] trial mode
[x]	 - limit to playing 30 levels. Don't count level 1
[x]	 - display "TRIAL VERSION - 30 LEVELS LEFT" in the top right corner.
[x]	 - when levels are all used up, display an upsell screen instead of progressing the level. This screen is a child screen of the main menu.
[x]	 - clicking 'continue' after resuming lets you replay the level you got up to, then you see the upsell again. (You do NOT get to go one level higher each time you continue!)
	  (note, the rational for this is that once the player buys the game, they can continue from their last trial version game.)
[x]	 - starting a new game will top you up to 4 levels left, and then the upsell.

2010-10-09

[x] 20 improve drawing of joystick - it looks square and lame.
[x] 10 make special stages a little shorter
[x] decreased split screen stage difficulty a tiny bit.
[=] 15 (can't reproduce) sometimes a star comes out too late, i.e. in level 13
[x] 30 improve special stage performance - pool special bullets. 
[x] 15 don't create bullets inside the shot loop + make bullets update consistently on first frame.
[x] set a maximum lightwave cannon ammo (two pickups worth)
[x] don't clear a special stage until all enemies are destroyed (fixed a bug where the enemies vanished on level end)
[x] when you lose, clear the saved game.
[x] serialize the player's powerups and score
[x] serialize if a player is dead!
[x] allow player to 'continue' from a saved game
[x] made the game full screen, fixing a scaling issue i didn't know i had.
[x] stop firing when there are no enemies.

- arts:
[x]	background.png 173x173 (maybe the player ship with a bubble)
[x]	gamethumbnail 62x62 (optional for games?)
[x]	Device Icon 99x99, 173x173
[x]	Desktop icon 200x200
[x]	1 - 8 screenshots

[x] disallow 4-way movement

I've decided, instead of true tombstoning, I will have a 'continue' button that works whether the game was reactivated or started afresh.
The game won't tombstone properly and the player will have to start from the start of their current level.
This is OK since each level is only 10 seconds long - but later, I might add true tombstoning to give a better experience after an interruption.

Woo, Microsoft have given me a slot in the first submission set :) although this means I only have two days to finish :o

2010-10-07
[x] Apply for early submission! (I didn't make the game look too amazing though, I'm anxious that they won't prioritise me...)
[x] 10 min rip out accelerometer entirely - because i can't test it, and it's not important, so it's a big risk with little reward.
[x] 30 min fixed-in-place joystick control. Can't test this for usability :{ but it ought to work.
[x] 20 persist options
[x] 20 display application name, version information, and technical support contact information
[x] 10 add a file format version number to the two high score files.

2010-10-06
(I performed the second test on a real device today)
[x] 2 player: if there is a touch on the dead player's side, somehow communicate that it won't do anything (big cross displays on that half)
[x] Music options are _required_ - SOUND ON\OFF, MUSIC ON\OFF
[x] reset player height when 4 way movement is disabled (or make him drift downwards)
[x] replace 'kills' with 'score'
- used y axis not z axis. still kinda doesn't work. tweaked accelerometer stuff. Fixed some accelerometer crash bugs.



2010-10-05
- special levels show their variety right from the start.

2010-10-04
- (very crudely done) make player 2 look different (and her shots, too)

2010-10-03
* accelerometer control scheme (totally untested)
* relative control scheme (totally untested)

* show instructions <- -> for single and two player

* two player mode
** controls
** menu option
** seperate high scores
** two player HUD with kills

* created a crude art scaler - scales up tiny pixel art.
* created crude art for all ship upgrades and pickups

* sped up player movement - made the whole game easier and more fun.

Decided to abandon the button control scheme.
I already have relative control and accelerometer control. No need for buttons as well. Probably.

2010-10-02
* fix loading so all assets load during the loading screen.
* a crude credits page.
* crude high scores screen, with persistence.
* show 'resume' when the game is paused (only if the game is still active, not lost.)

2010-10-01
* start of back button support - returns to menu, game can be resumed, but the menu does not say 'resume'

kinda already done: make sure particles never\rarely exceed 5000

2010-09-29
* fixed particles failing when there are too many particle groups

2010-09-27
* got to try the game on a real prototype device!
fun facts:
	it slowed down at 5000 particles. Not horrifically
	note, that was without music playing :/
	garbage collection is not noticable
	when a lot is going on, there was some framerate dropping (see: lightwave cannon!)
	I'm still using the tutorial game icon
	the accelerometer would be a better way to control it. (i might not get it the settings right though :/)
	No clues on when the marketplace opens - although perhaps not the first week of october?

2010-09-26
* um, something useful?
* messed with performance but i need a real test to know anything.
* removed all old fonts, all new fonts now!
* trying a different art style.
* added music
* readded projectiles pushing particles, made it fastish
* fixed: controls stopped responding after respawning player
* prioritised remaining work! 7 steps to release!

2010-09-25
* all sounds (i think...)
* removed most of the old 'Alien Game' tutorial code.
* scaled up to a full screen resolution - no idea if the game will perform at this resolution :/
* crudely scaled up images and gameplay math so most things work as before.

2010-09-24
* all power ups work. power ups are drawn on the player.

2010-09-21
* power up objects spawn and may be collected

2010-09-20

* started a changelog!
* added Stars - I now have all enemies from Space Octopus 1.0!

RANDOM TIPS ================================================

2010-10-10

wondered why my screenshots were coming out at the wrong size. Here's the answer:
http://www.robmiles.com/journal/2010/8/17/xna-games-and-windows-phone-screens.html
if you leave the status bar active, [...] The game will be scaled to the display size minus the status bar area, and you'll get letterboxing 
if you try to use the full 800x480 screen resolution. To make things a little harder, the bar size seems to be slightly larger in landscape than it is in portrait

graphics.IsFullScreen = true;

2010-10-05

To see it in the menu, change Genre="Apps.Games" to Genre="EmptyScreen" - dont' forget to change it back!

recolouring the same art set differently was a feature I was keen on, but now I don't want it
It's easy to make a whole new art set, and recolouring the same one could lead to player disappointment. Each custom artset should feel special.

2010-10-04

Thinking on art-sets:

I want very pixelly enemies to break into their base particles
hand drawn enemies should use smaller particles (never smaller than 4x4)
so each art set or each image must hold:
- the image
- the maximum particle size (from 4 to 13)
some attacks break things into smaller or larger particles i guess.

Are art sets just art or do they affect gameplay? This is the big awkward question.
If they affect gameplay they are much richer.

Maybe yes, but only in tiny ways.
	Gold art set - more powerups.
	fast art set, for skipping easy levels
etc.

Changing art sets on the fly - simple if creatures don't resize, etc.
I wold like creatures to resize but it's pretty gorram crazy now that i use the size for all the logic
so: logic off of the base size, and allow resizing.
or: each creature knows how to reconfigure itself (to some extent) so octos don't get their rows too confused.
or: just let things go crazy when you mess with art styles. That's fair.

2010-10-03

unlockables:

1. classic art style
2. golden art style
3. powerups
	start with speed, boost, rapidfire. Unlock these:
	* lightwave
	* bubble
	* spirit shots


2010-09-19

on my 17" monitors, 1280x1024, set the emulator scale to 40% for almost perfect sizing.

Graphic themes:

1. comic book
2. watercolour drawings
3. pencil sketch with soft pencil shading
4. papercraft

Scaling the game up to a new resolution will be a challenge.
	I should make all of the variables scale to screen size - player speed, shot speed, etc.

ElapsedGameTime = time since last Update (could be called "ElapsedUpdateTime")
ElapsedRealTime = time since last Draw (could be called "ElapsedDrawTime")
