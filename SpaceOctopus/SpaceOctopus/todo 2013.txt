[ ] Visual effect to make the revive powerup easier to understand
	a particle trail that zooms to that player? a projectile with a shimmery particle trail?

[ ] always have 2 ships, even in single player (the other is a bot)

[ ] remove the refire rate powerup... probably.

[ ] instructions shouldn't mention 's' key and the down arrow because they don't do anything.

[ ]	pixel perfect collisions for the player.
	i often notice rocks hurting me when they didn't really hit me

[ ] Special novelty levels

[ ] Make the game easier to install. Can I stop using XNA?

[ ] snails should not be able to lay shells on top of other shells.

[ ] fix balance \ pacing issues - too easy until level 30, too hard after that
	increasing damage should help

[ ] convey progress in some way other than 'Level 1' text.
[ ] use an audio cue for 'upgrade not needed', since we removed the text cue? (low priority, doesn't really matter)
[ ] don't save the game to disk - if you quit, you start over (the saving feature was for Windows Phone's tombstoning)
[ ] replace "Press Enter to restart" with a picture of the enter key
[ ] use a visual\audio cue for 'Player X is lost"

[ ] you only move upwards towards DesiredY when shake is zero.
(shake is shared between both players)

Tonight I'm adding this for Rabble Room:

[X] Game can run in full screen. This can be toggled in the Options menu.
	(going from full screen to windows makes Windows 7 display funny; maybe because I'm updating the resolution in Update instead of Draw?)
[X] Support mouse input
	This is Rabble Room only - it's for custom controls where one emulates mouseX, one emulates MouseY. No other buttons.
	MouseX controls P1, MouseY controls P2.
	Ships auto-fire, the game auto-starts and auto-resets when you lose. No button-presses required.

[x] Difficulty - everything is more damaging than before
[x] removed 'faster movement' powerup because it's not fun
[x] cleaned powerup code to use an enum

Wow, making this work with JSIL will be quite an adventure.
I'm amazed by how quickly I can get a little bit working.

JSIL compiles my SpaceOct.exe into javascript that runs in a browser!
Setting it up was easy - easier than almost any codebase I've ever devved on.

But then my game failed immediately - but the error messages are clear.
JSIL doesn't support threads - my game tries to load assets in a background thread. That's easily removed.
Next up, you can't check the state of a sound to tell if it's playing or not - OK, remove that sound for now.
Next, it gets tricky - the object pools I use to recycle Shots and other game objects don't work.
I think it's the generics. I guess I can un-generic-ify those object pools.

Done... and that works.

And... wow. The game runs! In a web browser!

The framerate is super-slow when there are particles on screen. Super dooper slow. That's unfortunate.
I wonder if it can be fixed - I've seen HTML5 demos that are pretty fast.
The particles also don't look right, I think the blending isn't working correctly. But they look kind of cool
even though it's not how I intended.

Still crashes when a player gets hit by a beam, that's another case where i'm checking the status of
a sound effect that's playing. That's not supported.

So, things that I'd need to fix to make it OK:
1. Improve particle effects performance (or give up on particles)
2. Add support for checking the state of a currently playing sound
Oh, one more thing - the music doesn't work!
The asset is in there but it doesn't play.

Time to focus on changes that have real benefits.

You no longer lose when enemies get past you.
- (this was a major cause of confusion in playtests)
- Frogs shoot darts out their sides when they get horizontally level with you.
  (so they are still dangerous even though going past you is now harmless)
- Octos, Monks, Snails just go past harmlessly and disappear. (todo: change this)

Refactor: moved shots to a separate file
Fixed: snails face the way they're going. They used to always face right.

The event was a great success!

Key feedback:

There's a balance issue, at around level 31, where the beams start coming constantly and frantically
I think the individual octos need to have no refire rate, and beams need to come from  the octos as a whole
getting constant  i.e. beam refiring should be done collectively, not per octo.
(if the pool of octos is too large, you get constant beam attacks.)

I need to balance it, but I still love the feeling when you get almost constant beam attacks - maybe that should
	be for octo-only levels.

It's not obvious that aliens getting past you makes you lose.
(Carl points out that it's inconsistent, as you let the mine-things go past you)

It's also hard to know which powerup causes which power. Michelle suggested color coding them,
 that would work really well but i don't want that many colors in the game.
	so we'll leave this problem for later.

snail shells - I didn't really think about it. They probably shouldn't drop powerups.
I thought they shouldn't require destroying to end the level, but carl felt it was ok - a nice pacing change.

snails should not be able to lay shells on top of other shells.

Carl commented on how with powerups that make you wider, you can go slightly off the side of the screen
The powerups don't change your collision size, but players don't know that...

I'm showing the game at an event on Saturday.
Let's focus on things to do before then.

Top priority:

[x] make the controls description a picture of keyboard keys, instead of just text
[x] menu fades in rather than boucing in.
	I tried changing it to a pixellated font but didn't like it - it wasn't very readable.
[x] make stars look cooler. yes! a simple art change made this enemy work much better. They're now frogs.

[x] new tile-laying enemy.
	the snail!
	moves horziontally across the screen
	drops snail-trails behind it. These absorb player shots.

[no] make octos and monks hang around above the player instead of going past.

Maybe priority:
[x] make the stars more interesting to battle. (a little - they're still not quite right)
[ ] something that will blow people away - something breathtaking
	something huge. (like a boss?)
		or a more special-looking special level.
			maybe special levels should be made out of custom objects, not generic blocks

[ ] some comedy waves
	[ ] invisible enemies wave
	[ ] rainbow particles wave
	[ ] a boss? need a boss.
	a three-eyed boss and you have to shoot the eye that is open
	[ ] a few new enemies?


[ ] make the menus better - the font and slide animation do not suit the game
[ ] tweak level progression? more interesting content
[ ] make a beautiful particle effect for rescuing
[ ] make a new artset, and all that crazy stuff
[ ] new enemy - they appear across the top of the screen,  then 'stomp' straight downwards, rapidly
[x] an enemy who builds a protective wall across the middle of the level (you have to shoot through it)
[ ] an enemy who sprays out projectiles which spin outwards in a spiral
[ ] a level where half the level is blocked off into solid wall

[ ] stealth wave
[ ] boss?

done:

[X] Remove almost all text from the game.
[X] megashots cut through an unlimited number of enemies, not only one (make it more overt and obvious)
[X] fix glitches with the Lightwave Cannon (by making it fire automatically, you can't stop firing with it)

2013-02-21
[ ] Bug: Sometimes I get a 'rescue' pickup but nothing happens.
	Fix: When a player respawns, grant them invulnerability until they are fully on screen

later:

Random ideas:
1. make the game always have 2 ships - it's 2 player or player + bot
2. add the bot, obviously
3. consider having no menus - jump straight into a 2-player game, AI takes over if the player doesn't.
Make more of a thing of sharing the space - encourage each player to pick a side. Occasionally make it wise to swap sides.
(how? powerups that are more effective against certain enemies, and enemies come on a certain side?)

An enemy that requires that the players syncronise their attacks? (annoying if one has refire rate upgrades)
an enemy that requires that the players attack at two different places at the same time
(get some syncronized movement in there - that'll be cool)
A level where upgrades appear at far sides of the screen at the same time. Oooh, the same upgrades keep appearing there,
which means the players have to swap to get the full range of upgrades :)
	(bubble sheilds on one side, spirit shots on the other)
