I'm showing the game at an event on Saturday.
Let's focus on things to do before then.

Before Saturday:

[ ] make the controls description a picture of keyboard keys, instead of just text
[ ] make the menus better - the font and slide animation do not suit the game
[x] make the stars more interesting to battle. (a little - they're still not quite right)
[ ] tweak level progression? more interesting content
[ ] make 'avoid' levels less random, more visually interesting
[ ] make a beautiful particle effect for rescuing
[ ] make a new artset, and all that crazy stuff
[ ] new enemy - they appear across the top of the screen,  then 'stomp' straight downwards, rapidly
[ ] stealth wave
[ ] boss?


done:

[X] Remove almost all text from the game.
[X] megashots cut through an unlimited number of enemies, not only one (make it more overt and obvious)
[X] fix glitches with the Lightwave Cannon (by making it fire automatically, you can't stop firing with it)

[ ] Bug: Sometimes I get a 'rescue' pickup but nothing happens.
	Fix: When a player respawns, grant them invulnerability until they are fully on screen



later:

[ ] convey progress in some way other than 'Level 1' text.
[ ] use an audio cue for 'upgrade not needed', since we removed the text cue? (low priority, doesn't really matter)
[ ] have a (non-text) cue for "Aliens got past you" (low priority because it almost never happens)
[ ] cue for 'aliens got past you'
[ ] don't save the game to disk - if you quit, you start over (the saving feature was for Windows Phone's tombstoning)

Later:

[ ] replace "Press Enter to restart" with a picture of the enter key
[ ] use a visual\audio cue for 'Player X is lost"

Random ideas:
1. make the game always have 2 ships - it's 2 player or player + bot
2. add the bot, obviously
3. consider having no menus - jump straight into a 2-player game, AI takes over if the player doesn't.
Make more of a thing of sharing the space - encourage each player to pick a side. Occasionally make it wise to swap sides.
(how? powerups that are more effective against certain enemies, and enemies come on a certain side?)

An enemy that requires that the players syncronise their attacks? (annoying if one has refire rate upgrades)
an enemy that requires that the players attack at two different places at the same time
(get some syncronized movement in there - that'll be cool)
A level where upgrades appear at far sides of the screen at the same time. Oooh, the same upgrades keep appearing there,
which means the players have to swap to get the full range of upgrades :)
